Complex queries of large databases, even when optimized, can take a significant amount of time -- so much so that it can inhibit pleasant UX. By caching complex queries which occur often, we can optimize-away the long wait times associated with those expensive SQL queries which occur the most often.\r\n\r\n# How Can I Cache SQL Queries?\r\nSQL queries can be cached in one of two ways -- they can be cached SQL-server side, or 'locally' inside the PHP script which is querying the database. \r\n###Caching on the SQL server\r\nThe first method is to have your SQL database cache the query internally using SQL 'hints' inside of database queries. \r\nThis can be achieved using the `MYSQLND_QC_ENABLE_SWITCH` hint, which, when wrapped inside an SQL query, tells the DBMS to save the output of that query for future use.\r\n\r\n    //The MYSQLND_QC_ENABLE_SWITCH flag at the start of the query tells SQL to cache the result.\r\n    $select = $db->query(\"/*\" . MYSQLND_QC_ENABLE_SWITCH . \"*/\" . \"SELECT * FROM table\");\r\n###Caching in the PHP environment\r\nThe second method is to save the results of a SQL query inside an associative array in the cache of a PHP process. This can be achieved using a library called `Memcached` which allows a PHP user to store data in local cache.\r\n\r\n    $cache = new Memcached(); //Build a new memcached object\r\n\t$cache->addServer('localhost', 11211); //11211 should always be the second parameter\r\n\t$key = 'some SQL query'; //This is the key for a key-value pair in the cache object\r\n\t$result = $cache->get($key); //See if there's data for this query in the cache\r\n\t//If there's nothing in the cache, we need to query the SQL server\r\n\tif (!$result) {\r\n        \r\n        //Execute the query on SQL server\r\n  \t    $select = db->query(\"SELECT first_name FROM employee where last_name = 'bob'\"); \r\n        $result = $select->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ); //Fetch result \r\n   \t    $cache->set($key, serialize($row)); //Load the result into the cache\r\n\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n###Cool. Now show me the code!\r\nCheck out this repository to see a simple example of both SQL-side caching and PHP-side caching!\r\n\r\n##A Third Approach\r\nSQL can also cache queries server-side using a slightly more sophisticated rule-based methodology. In PHP this is done using `mysqlnd_set_cache_condition()`. We won't get into that here, but you can read more [here] (http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysqlnd-qc-set-cache-condition.php)\r\n\r\n##Further Reference\r\nVisit [the PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqlnd-qc.quickstart.caching.php) for more information about SQL caching.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
